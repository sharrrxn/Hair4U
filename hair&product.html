	<p>•	Type 1B is mostly straight, but with more body than type 1A.</p>

	<p> <img src="type1c.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>Type 1A hair is the least common, but any type 1 hair can cause a love-hate relationship. It’s soft to the touch and frizz-free, but also stubborn and hard to handle. The shine of type 1 hair is a definite bonus. That beautiful glow is thanks to how easily natural oils from your scalp can move down each straight hair shaft. The downside is that those oils build up, leaving you with greasy hair, a lack of volume, and a constant battle.</p>

						<p>This B vitamin is an ingredient in many different hair supplements—for good reason.

Run low and you may notice your hair is weak, or you may start to lose it. </p>
						<p>You can expect the vitamin to increase the speed of hair growth, but it won’t increase thickness. However, it is far cheaper than other supplements, making it a good starting point. For one good biotin supplement.</p>

						<p><img src="vivi.jpg" width="200" height="200" ></p>
						<p>Containing a marine complex, as well as biotin, zinc, vitamin C, iron, and horsetail extract, Viviscal “uses vitamins to extend the anagen (growth) phase of the hair growth cycle,” says Dr. Engelman. In a 2015 study published in Dermatology Research and Practice found that after 90 days, adult women taking Viviscal had an increase in hair volume and lost significantly fewer hairs after washing compared to a placebo.</p>

								<h4>Tips for Frizz Control</h4>
									<p>Frizz can happen to straight hair if it’s dry or damaged from too much heat-styling, bleaching, and dyeing. Chemical processing and heat-styling burn the hair’s cuticle, causing your would-be sleek locks to appear puffy, kinky, even straw-like. Too much friction from brushing and vigorous towel-drying can also ruffle the cuticle, creating unsightly frizz.</p>
									<p>Infusium Repair and Renew Smoothing Serum</p>
									<p> <img src="infusium.jpg" width="200" height="200" ></p>
									<p>If you have damaged hair, this serum will do wonders for your locks. It claims to repair, restore and restructure your hair with powerful ingredients like argan oil and keratin which also eliminates frizz and protects hair against humidity.
										“As you can tell from the name, this product smooths frizz instantly while taming flyaways. I usually massage two to three drops on either wet or dry hair — it works on both — to keep frizz at bay,” said Johnny Lavoy, a Connecticut-based hairstylist.</p>

	<h1>Type 2 Hair!</h1>
	<p>There are three main types of wavy hair. Type 2 is the “in-between” hair type. It’s not completely straight nor is it completely curly. It’s not too dry, nor is it too oily. You can tell if your hair is Type 2 by looking at the curl pattern.</p>
	<p>•	Type 2A is fine and thin with a loose S pattern, and it’s generally easy to manage.</p>
	<p> <img src="type2a.jpg"></p>
	<p>•	Type 2B is medium thickness with a more defined S shape, prone to frizz and harder to manage.</p>
	<p><img src="type2b.jpg"></p>
	<p>•	Type 2C is coarse and thick with a prominent S pattern, almost curly, and it’s difficult to style.</p>
	<p><img src="type2c.jpg"></p>
	<p>Type 2 hair is often frizzy, but it’s typically not overly oily or too dry. Naturally wavy hair curls in an S shape determined by the number of bonds formed between the keratin protein in the hair shaft. Understanding your hair type is the first step in figuring out the styles and products that are right for your hair.</p>

		<h1> Type 3 Hair!</h1>

	<p>Naturally curly hair is classified as type 3 hair in celebrity stylist Andre Walker’s Hair Typing System. He determined that hair falls into four categories, which he breaks down each category into various subtypes. </p>
	<p>•	Type 3A is loosely curly hair with S-shaped curls that may lack volume and appear flat.</p>
	<p><img src="type3a.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>•	Type 3B has more tightly curled S-pattern curls or loosely spiraled curls with more volume than type 3A.</p>
	<p><img src="type3b.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>•	Type 3C is tight spiral curls are densely packed, have a tendency to coil, yet are prone to dryness</p>
	<p><img src="type3c.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>•	Step 1: Simply grab a pencil, a permanent marker, and a piece of sidewalk chalk.
•	Step 2: Loosely wrap one of your curls around each item.
•	Step 3: Evaluate which item fits the best in your curls.
</p>
	<p>If your curls easily wrap around the sidewalk chalk, then you have type 3A hair. If the permanent marker is the best fit, then your hair type is 3B. If your spiral curls are the size of a pencil, you have type 3C hair.</p>
